# RSA-Encryption
#### Java RSA Encryption

This is an RSA Encryption that I implemented in Java using BigIntegers for my Crypto class at Butler. I had less than 24 hours to write this program. It isn't a testament to my programming ability, but shows that I have some knowledge about cryptology.

##### A few notes regarding the program:
1. The program does not handle many error exceptions and does not fail gracefully.
2. I let the variable names be the same as those used by Thomas Barr in his book. Unfortunately, they aren't too descriptive.
